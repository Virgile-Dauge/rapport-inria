In this paper we describe a bio-inspired controller able to generate locomotion and switch between different type of gaits for an hexapod robot. Motor patterns are generated by coupled Central Pattern Generators formulated as nonlinear oscillators. These patterns are modulated by a drive signal, proportionally changing the oscillators frequency, amplitude and the coupling parameters among the oscillators. Locomotion initiation, stopping and smooth gait switching is achieved by changing the drive signal. We also demonstrate a posture controller for hexapod robots using the dynamical systems approach. Results from simulation using a model of the Chiara hexapod robot demonstrate the capability of the controller both to locomotion generation and smooth gait transition. The postural controller is also tested in different situations in which the hexapod robot is expected to maintain balance. The presented results prove its reliability.},

The main issue when applying impedance control in this robot is the body attitude stability during walking on the uneven terrain that contains of major soft surface. The impedance controller is derived for each leg from vertical motion changes. In addition self-tuning stiffness method is proposed as an adaptive element from the changes of the robot's body attitude vector (magnitude), to ensure the robot is self-adapted with the changes of stepped ground. On the other hand, compliant walking mechanism is designed for force-based walking trajectory and proposed impedance controller integration. The proposed controller and mechanism are verified by running the robot on the designed uneven terrain (extremely soft surface) in the laboratory using critical condition of side walking setting.},

RHex has only six actuators—one motor located at each hip— achieving mechanical simplicity that promotes reliable and robust operation in real-world tasks. Empirically stable and highly maneuverable locomotion arises from a very simple clock-driven, open-loop tripod gait. The legs rotate full circle, thereby preventing the common problem of toe stubbing in the protraction (swing) phase. An extensive suite of experimental results documents the robot’s significant “intrinsic mobility”—the traversal of rugged, broken, and obstacle-ridden ground without any terrain sensing or actively controlled adaptation. RHex achieves fast and robust forward locomotion traveling at speeds up to one body length per second and traversing height variations well exceeding its body clearance.},

	abstract = {This paper compares three insect inspired controllers which were implemented on an autonomous hexapod robot. There is a growing interest in using insect locomotion schemes to control walking robots. Researchers' interest in insect-based controllers ranges from understanding the biological basis of locomotion control in insects to building real-time walking machines which require relatively little computational power. Several models for insect locomotion exist, and robotics researchers tend to adopt one approach and experiment with it.

In contrast, this paper offers a comparison of three insect inspired controllers — all of which were implemented and tested on the same autonomous hexapod robot. Some of the controllers used reflex-based mechanisms whereas others used pattern-based mechanisms. Reflexive controllers exploit sensory stimulus and response reactions to produce leg motion and gait coordination. In contrast, pattern-based controllers depend more upon pre-programmed patterns of behavior which may be influenced by external events. Typically, these pre-programmed patterns of behavior are implemented using central pattern generators (CPGs).

In this work, we compare gait coordination performance of three controllers on flat terrain. We extend the comparison to include leg loading considerations, disabled leg compensation, and externally applied leg perturbations. We discuss the differences between controllers with respect to inconsistent leg retraction velocities, leg design issues, sensing requirements, and computational issues. The robot performed quite differently under varying experimental conditions depending upon which controller was used. We found that controller performance was the most sensitive to robot design parameters. For our case, we had the most success with pattern-based mechanisms given the leg design of our robot and its limitations in controlling the retraction velocity of its legs. The pattern-based mechanisms allowed the robot to remain stable over a variety of gaits while the robot was subjected to loading the legs, disabling a leg, and physically disturbing the legs. The reflexive mechanisms were less successful at maintaining stability when the robot's legs were increasingly disrupted.},

	abstract = {Robots have transformed many industries, most notably manufacturing, and have the power to deliver tremendous benefits to society, such as in search and rescue, disaster response, health care and transportation. They are also invaluable tools for scientific exploration in environments inaccessible to humans, from distant planets to deep oceans. A major obstacle to their widespread adoption in more complex environments outside factories is their fragility. Whereas animals can quickly adapt to injuries, current robots cannot /`think outside the box/' to find a compensatory behaviour when they are damaged: they are limited to their pre-specified self-sensing abilities, can diagnose only anticipated failure modes, and require a pre-programmed contingency plan for every type of potential damage, an impracticality for complex robots. A promising approach to reducing robot fragility involves having robots learn appropriate behaviours in response to damage, but current techniques are slow even with small, constrained search spaces. Here we introduce an intelligent trial-and-error algorithm that allows robots to adapt to damage in less than two minutes in large search spaces without requiring self-diagnosis or pre-specified contingency plans. Before the robot is deployed, it uses a novel technique to create a detailed map of the space of high-performing behaviours. This map represents the robot/'s prior knowledge about what behaviours it can perform and their value. When the robot is damaged, it uses this prior knowledge to guide a trial-and-error learning algorithm that conducts intelligent experiments to rapidly discover a behaviour that compensates for the damage. Experiments reveal successful adaptations for a legged robot injured in five different ways, including damaged, broken, and missing legs, and for a robotic arm with joints broken in 14 different ways. This new algorithm will enable more robust, effective, autonomous robots, and may shed light on the principles that animals use to adapt to injury.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, robots are designed to interact with the environment, including humans and tools. Legged robots, in particular, have to deal with environmental contacts every time they take a step. To handle these interactions properly, it is desirable to be able to set the robot's dynamic behavior, i.e., its impedance. In this contribution, we investigate the most relevant theoretical and practical aspects in impedance control using hydraulic actuators, ranging from the force dynamics analysis and model-based controller design to the overall stability and performance assessment. We present results with one leg of the quadruped robot HyQ and also highlight the influence of hardware parameters, such as valve bandwidth and inertia, in the impedance and force tracking. In addition, we demonstrate the capabilities of HyQ's actively compliant leg by experimentally comparing it with a passively compliant version of the same leg. With such a broad spectrum of analyses and discussions, this paper aims to serve as a practical and comprehensive guide for implementing high-performance impedance control on highly dynamic hydraulic robots.},

The design principle was inspired by the starfish, which possesses a remarkable symmetrical structure and soft internal skeleton. A soft robot body was constructed by using 3D printing technology. A kinematic model of the SMA spring was built and developed for motion control according to displacement and force requirements. The locomotion inspired from starfish was applied to the implementation of the multi-ray robot through the flexible actuation induced multi-gait movements in various environments. By virtue of the proposed ray control patterns in gait transition, the soft robot was able to cross over an obstacle approximately twice of its body height. Results also showed that the speed of the soft robot was 6.5 times faster on sand than on a clammy rough terrain. These experiments demonstrated that the bionic soft robot with flexible rays actuated by SMAs and multi-gait locomotion in proposed patterns can perform successfully and smoothly in various terrains.},

Kinematic structure, relative proportion of leg segment lengths and actuation system were analyzed in consideration of anatomical structure as well as muscle system of insect legs and desired mobility. A spring based passive compliance mechanism inspired by musculoskeletal structures of biological systems was integrated into distal segment of the leg to soften foot impact on touchdown. In addition, an efficient locomotion planner capable of generating natural movements for the legs during swing phase was proposed. The problem of leg swing was formulated as an optimal control procedure that satisfies a series of locomotion task terms while minimizing a biologically-based objective function, which was solved by a Gauss Pseudospectral Method (GPM) based numerical technique. We applied this swing generation algorithm to both a simulation platform and a robot prototype. Results show that the proposed leg structure and swing planner are able to successfully perform effective swing movements on rugged terrains.},

A tripod gait is achieved with a hexapedal configuration and four-bar-based repeated motion of the legs. The hexapedal configuration is empirically proven to have an advantage in terms of rolling stability on water. On ground, the tripod gait can satisfy the requirements of static stability to make the center of gravity and center of pressure occur at the same position. The footpad design was determined based on an empirical study of the rolling stability and lifting force.

The proposed leg obtains a straight-line constant-velocity motion of the foot as only one of its 3 motors is operated at constant speed. This feature, together with the hybrid structure, increases the robot’s efficiency and speed when operating on surfaces without obstacles, and drastically simplifies the walking operation control. A series of simulations have been done comparing the energy consumption of the hybrid robot including traditional coupled legs, and including the proposed decoupled legs. They show a superior performance of the later one. A real prototype has been built including the proposed mechanism.

In this article, we focus on the development of a quadruped locomotion controller able to generate omnidirectional locomotion and a path planning controller for heading direction. The heading direction controller is able to adapt to sensory-motor visual feedback, and online adapt its trajectory according to visual information that modifies the control parameters. This allows for integration of sensory-motor feedback and closed-loop control. This issue is crucial for autonomous and adaptive control, and has received little attention so far. This modeling is based on the concept of dynamical systems.

We present experiments performed on a real AIBO platform. The obtained results demonstrate both the adequacy of the proposed locomotor controller to generate the required trajectories and to generate the desired movement in terms of the walking velocity, orientation and angular velocity. Further, the controller is demonstrated on a simulated quadruped robot which walks towards a visually acquired target while avoiding online-visually detected obstacles in its path.},

	abstract = {An originally chaotic system can be controlled into various periodic dynamics. When it is implemented into a legged robot’s locomotion control as a central pattern generator (CPG), sophisticated gait patterns arise so that the robot can perform various walking behaviors. However, such a single chaotic CPG controller has difficulties dealing with leg malfunction. Specifically, in the scenarios presented here, its movement permanently deviates from the desired trajectory. To address this problem, we extend the single chaotic CPG to multiple CPGs with learning. The learning mechanism is based on a simulated annealing algorithm. In a normal situation, the CPGs synchronize and their dynamics are identical. With leg malfunction or disability, the CPGs lose synchronization leading to independent dynamics. In this case, the learning mechanism is applied to automatically adjust the remaining legs’ oscillation frequencies so that the robot adapts its locomotion to deal with the malfunction. As a consequence, the trajectory produced by the multiple chaotic CPGs resembles the original trajectory far better than the one produced by only a single CPG. The performance of the system is evaluated first in a physical simulation of a quadruped as well as a hexapod robot and finally in a real six-legged walking machine called AMOSII. The experimental results presented here reveal that using multiple CPGs with learning is an effective approach for adaptive locomotion generation where, for instance, different body parts have to perform independent movements for malfunction compensation.},

	abstract = {. This article investigates the neural mechanisms underlying salamander locomotion, and develops a biologically plausible connectionist model of a central pattern generator capable of producing the typical aquatic and terrestrial gaits of the salamander. It investigates, in particular, what type of neural circuitry can produce and modulate the two locomotor programs identified within the salamander's spinal cord; namely, a traveling wave of neural activity for swimming and a standing wave for trotting. A two-dimensional biomechanical simulation of the salamander's body is developed whose muscle contraction is determined by the locomotion controller simulated as a leaky-integrator neural network. While the connectivity of the neural circuitry underlying locomotion in the salamander has not been decoded for the moment, this article presents the design of a neural circuit that has a general organization corresponding to that hypothesized by neurobiologists. In particular, the locomotion controller is based on a body central pattern generator (CPG) corresponding to a lamprey-like swimming controller, and is extended with a limb CPG for controlling the salamander's limbs. The complete controller is developed in three stages: first the development of segmental oscillators, second the development of intersegmental coupling for the making of a lamprey-like swimming CPG, and finally the development of the limb CPG and its coupling to the body CPG. A genetic algorithm is used to determine the parameters of the neural circuit for the different stages, given a high-level description of the desired state space trajectories of the different subnetworks. A controller is thus developed that can produce neural activities and locomotion gaits very similar to those observed in the real salamander. By varying the tonic (i.e. non-oscillating) excitation applied to the network, the speed, direction and type of gait can be varied.},

	abstract = {As the engine behind many life phenomena, motor information generated by the central nervous system plays a critical role in the activities of all animals. In this work, a novel, macroscopic and model-independent approach is presented for creating different patterns of coupled neural oscillations observed in biological central pattern generators (CPG) during the control of legged locomotion. Based on a simple distributed state machine, which consists of two nodes sharing pre-defined number of resources, the concept of oscillatory building blocks (OBBs) is summarised for the production of elaborated rhythmic patterns. Various types of OBBs can be designed to construct a motion joint of one degree of freedom with adjustable oscillatory frequencies and duty cycles. An OBB network can thus be potentially built to generate a full range of locomotion patterns of a legged animal with controlled transitions between different rhythmic patterns. It is shown that gait pattern transition can be achieved by simply changing a single parameter of an OBB module. Essentially, this simple mechanism allows for the consolidation of a methodology for the construction of artificial CPG architectures behaving as an asymmetric Hopfield neural network. Moreover, the proposed CPG model introduced here is amenable to analogue and/or digital circuit integration.},

In this contribution we present a CPG design based on coupled oscillators, generating the required stepping movements of a limb for omnidirectional motion. Movements are online modulated through small value changes in the CPG's parameters as required to perform the desired omnidirectional locomotion in a quadruped robot. We also present a methodology to modulate the CPG's parameters, reducing the control dimensionality, described in terms of the robot's translational speed, angular velocity and walking orientation.

Therefore with the proposed method, the main target of study is to overcome the hexapod walking and stepping on the uneven terrain with multi-directional movements. This proposed combination method is done to guarantee the stability of the robot and increasing the flexibility of the robot during rotating and zigzaging on uneven terrain.

Legged locomotion is more advantageous in traversing complex terrain but requires constant monitoring and correction to maintain system stability. This paper presents a multi-legged reactive stability control method for maintaining system stability under external perturbations. Assuming tumbling instability and sufficient friction to prevent slippage, the reactive stability control method is based solely on the measured foot forces normal to the contact surface, reducing computation time and sensor information. Under external perturbations, the reactive stability control method opts to either displace the CG or the foot contacts of the robot based on the measured foot force distribution. Details describing the reactive stability control method are discussed including algorithms and an implementation example. An experimental demonstration of the reactive stability control method is presented. The experiment was conducted on a hexapod robot platform retrofitted with a tiny computer and force sensitive resistors to measure the foot forces. The experimental results show that the presented reactive stability control strategy prevents the robot from tipping over under external perturbation.},

The first algorithm determines the relevant dynamic elements of the system for each phase of motion, and the second algorithm finds the simple mechanism described by the remaining dynamic elements.

This robot is able to pass through a narrow space because it can extend and shrink the size between the wheels by changing the configuration of the legs. In this study, obstacle avoidance is achieved by two passage width constraints. Obstacle size and wheel positions are considered in those constraints. A distance between the robot and an obstacle is kept larger than a value specified by those constraints. Comparing with conventional artificial potential methods, the proposed method does not require tuning of obstacle parameters. We utilize two kinds of linear constraints. In the first constraint, we use the internal common tangent between the robot and the obstacle nearest to the robot. In the other constraint, we use the external common tangent to reduce getting stuck into the narrow space between obstacles. The optimal tracking control is realized using those constraints for the model predictive control. The efficacy of this method is verified via the numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {Author Summary    The problem of motor coordination of complex multi-joint movements has been recognized as very difficult in biological as well as in technical systems. The high degree of redundancy of such movements and the complexity of their dynamics make it hard to arrive at robust solutions. Biological systems, however, are able to move with elegance and efficiency, and they have solved this problem by a combination of appropriate biomechanics, neuronal control, and adaptivity. Human walking is a prominent example of this, combining dynamic control with the physics of the body and letting it interact with the terrain in a highly energy-efficient way during walking or running. The current study is the first to use a similar hybrid and adaptive, mechano–neuronal design strategy to build and control a small, fast biped walking robot and to make it learn to adapt to changes in the terrain to a certain degree. This study thus presents a proof of concept for a design principle suggested by physiological findings and may help us to better understand the interplay of these different components in human walking as well as in other complex movement patterns.},

Other modules, like the velocity regulating and the phase switching networks, enable the machines to perform omnidirectional walking as well as reactive behaviors, like obstacle avoidance and different types of tropisms. These behaviors are generated in a sensori-motor loop with respect to appropriate sensor inputs, to which a neural preprocessing is applied. The neuromodules presented are small so that their structure–function relationship can be analysed. The complete controller is general in the sense that it can be easily adapted to different types of even-legged walking machines without changing its internal structure and parameters.},

	abstract = {In this paper the authors present the architecture of the planar biped robot "RunBot". It has been developed on the basis of three hierarchical levels: biomechanical, local and central. The biomechanical level concerns an appropriate biomechanical design of RunBot which utilizes some principles of passive walkers to ensure stability. The local level is a low-level neuronal structure which generates dynamically stable gaits as well as fast motions with some degree of self-stabilization to guarantee basic robustness. In the central level, we simulate a mechanism for synaptic plasticity which allows RunBot to autonomously learn to adapt its locomotion to different terrains, e.g. level floor versus up or down a ramp. As a result, the structural coupling of all these levels generates adaptive, fast dynamic walking of RunBot.},

Using the restrictedness to decide when to lift the legs has previously been shown to allow omnidirectional walking using a free gait as well as a tripod gait during straight-ahead walking. In this paper, we develop the previous system to improve the range of forward walking gaits exhibited by the restrictedness controller to include a range of “wave gaits.” A simplified robot model was used for an off-line search for the optimal restrictedness components for forward walking. Experimental results from the small hexapod “Hamlet” are presented to show the worth of the restrictedness concept and the modeling process.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a gait control algorithm for limb-mechanism robot on rough terrains and slopes. The concept of the "limb-mechanism" is to integrate functions of legged locomotion and arm manipulation. A limb can be used as a leg and an arm according to different situations. Each limb radiates out in six directions and the robot has a symmetrical configuration in horizontal and vertical directions. The robot can walk into any direction using a simple motion planning where the same trajectory is assumed in each leg. This trajectory is generated on a cylindrical volume which is defined in the leg workspace. The robot has a touch sensor at the tip of each leg. The sensor can detect the contact with the ground, and the legs can stay on the ground stably. When the robot walks on a rough terrain, the body is inclined in parallel to the virtual plane defined by leg supporting points in order to use the leg workspace effectively. The stability margin of the robot can be also improved easily by changing the leg trajectory.},
